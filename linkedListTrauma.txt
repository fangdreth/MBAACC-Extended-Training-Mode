im figuring this out.
i dont have 2v2 and i have an 8 hour trainride

break at 004c04e0
	ebx loops 0,1,640(dec 1600, length of list)
	does this mean that on the base linkedlistaddr(005550a8), it is only doing things on those addrs?
	
issue:
	where in the code should i break in order to properly inspect the list each time
	where is it cleared
	
	im going to try breaking at 40e499 (AS IN BEFORE THE CALL)	
		
		
ugh
checking out 004c02b0
checks [[listAddr] +0] != 0 && [[listAddr] + 8] == 0
	weird that it wants +8 to be 0?
	
005550B0 is also,,, something. wtf
i dont understand how the fuck i didnt get that address earlier?? it seems so important
